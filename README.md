# **GNCsim: Python Library for Satellite & Launch Vehicle GNC**  

🚀 **GNCsim** is a modular Python library for **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)** of satellites and launch vehicles. It includes **trajectory simulation, attitude dynamics, and interactive 3D visualization** for better analysis and debugging.  

---

## **Features**  
✔ **Guidance & Trajectory Simulation** – Solve optimal flight paths for rockets and satellites.  
✔ **Attitude Dynamics & Control** – Quaternion-based attitude propagation and stabilization.  
✔ **Modular Design** – Easily extendable with additional features.  
✔ **Realistic 3D Visualization** – Interactive rocket tracking with lighting, camera control, and animations.  
✔ **Multi-Environment Support** – Simulates both space and atmospheric flight.
